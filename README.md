As a software engineer and the founder of Aremac, I am passionate about creating technologies and innovating in various fields. I have been developing apps using SwiftUI, Model-View-Controller (MVC), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) since 2020, and I have multiple projects in the works. My goal is to combine my skills and interests to make a positive impact in the world.
